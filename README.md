- 👋 Hi, welcome to my GitHub! <3
- 🚀 I'm Emma Stensland—an electrical engineering undergrad with minors in CS and CpE, and a knack for accidentally becoming the go-to person for solving weird technical problems.
- 👀 When I’m not engineering, I’m painting (sometimes professionally), volunteering, writing a novel, in the woods, or catching rides to my next side quest. I care about good documentation, inclusive outreach, and building things that actually function in the real world.
