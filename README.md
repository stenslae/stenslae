- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my GitHub! <3
- ğŸš€ I'm Emma Stenslandâ€”an electrical engineering undergrad with minors in CS and CpE.
- ğŸ‘€ When Iâ€™m not engineering, Iâ€™m painting (sometimes professionally), volunteering, writing a novel, in the woods, or catching rides to my next side quest. I care about good documentation, inclusive outreach, and building things that actually function in the real world.
